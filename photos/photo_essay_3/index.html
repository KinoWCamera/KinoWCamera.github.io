    It is a neoclasical building with a cafe/bar in the ground floor and a
    beautiful apartment in the first floor, where the owners of the cafe used to live in.
    Things seems pretty good up there, all the furniture were in place even the
    closets full of clothes, the kids bedroom full of toys and the light from the sun
