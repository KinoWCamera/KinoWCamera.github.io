		<span>Hi,</span>
		my name is Kostas and I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.skroutz.gr">Skroutz.gr</a>.
		Besides my life as a developer I enjoy photography. I am self-taught and started my involvement with photography in 2012.
		I like urban and sub-urban landscapes which emit the feeling of loneliness, abandonment and curiosity.
		Nowadays I shoot mostly film because I don't have much time for post processing my digital images.
