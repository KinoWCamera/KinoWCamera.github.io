Hey there!

Few days ago I accidentally scanned the same negative twice.
The first one without any additional enhancements features enabled, and the second one with my default procedure and Digital ICE technology enabled.
  

So I thought, why not post the results of this accident?

## First things first
My scanner is an **Epson Perfection V550** which supports Digital ICE technology.

>Digital ICE Technology is a hardware-based dust removal method that is more accurate than the Dust Removal feature. Digital ICE Technology can remove dust or scratch marks without affecting the image composition. However, it takes longer to scan using Digital ICE Technology and also uses more of your system resources.

## Lets see the results now:

It's difficult to spot the differences, so lets do some cropping.

## My thoughts

**You have a $200 flatbed scanner, do not expect professional print quality scans!**
It can of course, with good configuration, produce remarkable results which can be printed and excellent results for digital use (website - social media).

With that in mind I choose to use **Digital ICE** in my scans because it reduces my time in post processing. 
Yes there is a slightly image degradation, but for me its not noticeable, especially for *jpegs* images 3-times smaller than the original scans.

Now Dust Removal Is the worst enhancement in my opinion. It does a good job removing dust but many times removes more than dust. 
And things that are not dust may be something crucial in your photo. 
The good thing is that it's pretty fast compared to the Digital ICE technology.

Last but not least the option not to use any of the available enhancements is by many the best thing if you want the finest quality.
Yes thats true! When you have a raw scan and then export it to Photoshop or Lightroom you can achieve the best quality.

**This although, requires a significant amount of time which in my opinion does not justify the final result quality difference.**
  
### **TL;DR**

- **Digital Ice** Removes Dust, Scratches AND Detail
- **Dust Removal** Removes Dust and not only Dust 
- **No Enhancements used** adds more work to Posts Processing 

Happy Scanning! :)
